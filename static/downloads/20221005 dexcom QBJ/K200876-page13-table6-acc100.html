Historical Glucose Data: Users can view their previous six, or twelve hours of glucose data on a graph with high/low glucose thresholds. Time in Range: Users can view the percent of time they spend in their target glucose range based on their configured high/low glucose thresholds.</td>

The accuracy of the proposed G6 CGM System was demonstrated to meet the iCGM (21 CFR 862.1355) Special Controls requirements (Section 20, Performance Testing - Clinical). Dexcom conducted software verification and validation to ensure predefined requirements were met (Section 16, Software Verification and Validation Testing).</td>
