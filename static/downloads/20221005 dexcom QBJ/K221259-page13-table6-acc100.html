      <td>The Dexcom G6 Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom G6 Pro System) is a real time continuous glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older in a home environment while under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The Dexcom G6 Pro System is intended to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. Interpretation of the real-time Dexcom G6 Pro System results should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time. The Dexcom G6 Pro System may also be used as a retrospective glucose recording device indicated for assessing glycemic variability in persons age 2 years and older in a home environment while under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Retrospective interpretation of data recorded by the Dexcom G6 Pro System should be conducted solely by a healthcare professional.  The Dexcom G6 Pro System aids in detecting glucose excursions facilitating care plan adjustments. The Dexcom G6 Pro System is also intended to interface with digitally connected devices. The Dexcom G6 Pro System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected medical devices for managing diabetes or assessing glycemic variability.</td>
