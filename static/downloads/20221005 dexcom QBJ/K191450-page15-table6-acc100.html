      <td>The Dexcom Pro Q Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom Pro Q System) is a factory calibrated continuous glucose recording device indicated for the retrospective discovery, analysis, and interpretation of glycemic variability in persons age 2 years and older under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The Dexcom Pro Q System collects and processes data for aiding in the management of a disease or condition related to glycemic control. Interpretation of the data recorded by the Dexcom Pro Q System results should be made only by a qualified healthcare professional based on glucose trends and several sequential readings over time. The Dexcom Pro Q System aids in detecting glucose excursions facilitating care plan adjustments. The Dexcom Pro Q System is also intended to interface with digitally connected devices.</td>
