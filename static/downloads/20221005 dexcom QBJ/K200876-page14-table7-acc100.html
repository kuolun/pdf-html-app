      <td>Substantially Equivalent with no adverse impact on safety or effectiveness. Noise Management was modified to better handle noise events to improve data availability while retaining the accuracy. Additionally, progressive sensor decline was modified to improve detectability of sensors which are approaching end of life. The accuracy of the proposed G6 CGM System was demonstrated to meet the iCGM (21 CFR 862.1355) Special Controls requirements (Section 20, Performance Testing - Clinical). Software verification and validation demonstrated the proposed G6 firmware meets the predefined requirements (Section 16, Software Verification and Validation Testing).</td>
